The map largely leaves the status quo in place: Although the map moves some turf from the 3rd District into the 2nd District in order to account for population changes, its partisan breakdown is the same as the current map: three white-majority, solidly Republican districts and one Black-majority, solidly Democratic district (the 2nd District).", "Enacted"));

As a result, multiple federal lawsuits claim the map dilutes the political power of Black voters, in violation of the Voting Rights Act and/or the U.S. Constitution. However, the delay in making the maps official meant the lawsuits were filed too close to the May 24 primary, and on Feb. 28 a judge cited that fact in allowing the maps to stand, at least for the 2022 election.", "Proposed"));
