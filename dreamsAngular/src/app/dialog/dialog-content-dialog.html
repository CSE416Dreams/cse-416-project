    <h2>What is it</h2>
    Every state has a number of congressional districts, proportional to the state population. Population is recalculated after a US Census. District boundaries must be recalculated if the
number of representatives change or population shifts.
    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    Start by navigating to the top-right - <em>Select a state</em> - and select a state.
    You can see and compare the most recent districting plans and view the statistical analysis comparing various plans.
